# Jianing Yao's Project 1 for Biostat 777

My name is Jianing Yao. I am a first-year PhD student at the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. My first attempt to create and deploy a website can be found here: <https://jianingyao.github.io/biostat777-intro-jianing-yao/>.

Details of how to create such websites using `quarto` can be found at Dr. Hicks's [lecture site](<https://www.stephaniehicks.com/jhustatprogramming2023/posts/2023-10-26-build-website/>) and `quarto` [official website](<https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html>).
