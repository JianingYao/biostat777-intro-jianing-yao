# Jianing Yao's Project 1 for Biostat 777

My name is Jianing Yao. I am a first-year PhD student at the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. My first attempt to create and deploy a website can be found here: \[https://jianingyao.github.io/biostat777-intro-jianing-yao/\](https://jianingyao.github.io/biostat777-intro-jianing-yao/).

Details of how to create such websites using quarto can be found at Dr. Hicks's \[lecture site\](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/jhustatprogramming2023/posts/2023-10-26-build-website/) and the \`quarto\` \[official website\](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html).
